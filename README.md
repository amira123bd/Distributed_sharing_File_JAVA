IMPLEMENTATION OF A FILE SHARING APPLICATION
Main idea:
Implementing a P2P architecture in which Peers that represent a student  can download files from each other without the need of a server.

Inspiration:Napster Topology
it is a centralized architecture 
*Information about files are stored on a napster server 
*clients connects to the server
*if a client want to download a file , he must access to the server

Optimization:
*clients will act as a client and as a server .
*files transfered  directly between clients.
Group leader:
*track the contents of its children
